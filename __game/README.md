# __game

This folder contains a sample lua map and a sample gameobject.dll put it into the folder your editor resolves for '.' (The folder where the .sln file sits for Visual Studio for instance)
for testing the setup and update method of the gameobject is called in map.cpp

The source files are in the src folder, compile them separately. Your ide will probably complain that it can't execute the dll, that's to be expected.
